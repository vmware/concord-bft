/**
 * Range Validation Blocks Manager (RVBM) is part of BCStateTran (State Transfer).
 * It's responsible for managing RVB data and provided services as a source/destination which support BFT block
 * validation and block collection in chronological order. Without block validation, while collecting blocks in
 * chronological order (old to new), any Byzantine source replica may cause DOS on State Transfer.
 *
 * RVBM currently holds its main (RVB) data structure as a RangeValidationTree (RVT). It makes sure for the integrity,
 * persistency and update of this data. We can divide its duties and services to BCStateTran (by its public API) into
 * few areas:
 *
 * 1) During checkpointing - as a consensus replica:
 *  a) Collects pruned blocks digest and persists them until the next checkpoint.
 *  b) In each checkpoint updates the RVT according to the recent blocks added/removed to/from storage during the last
 *     checkpoint.
 *
 * 2) During State Transfer - as a source replica/consensus replica:
 *  a) Each replica sends its serialized in-memory RVT for a specifically requested checkpoint to a destination.
 *  b) Source sends requested RVB group digests, which can only be found in storage (level 0 of the RVT). These digests
 *     will support RVB validation during block collection in a destination. RVB validation group is a group of RVB
 *     which can help validate RVTs level 1 node values which are already found in destination (received during
 *     checkpoint summaries stage).
 *
 * 3) During State Transfer - as a destination replica:
 *    RVBM holds the target checkpoint RVT and provides services to validate RVB group and RVB blocks.
 *
 * 4) During initialization:
 *    a) Loads pruned blocks digests and the last checkpoint RVB data.
 *    b) If there is no last checkpoint, RVBM reconstructs the RVB data from storage.
