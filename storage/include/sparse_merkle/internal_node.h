                                  /            \

Note that a LeafChild *never* has any children below it, but an InternalChild
always does. An InternalChild at level 0 indicates more children in other
BatchedInternalNodes further down the tree.

Please refer to this diagram to understand the types of children in a
BatchedInternalNode and their corresponding header comments.

// We use a similar logical layout to libra for trees that are not full. Further
// quoting the libra source:
//
//       "As illustrated above, at nibble height 0, `0..F` in hex denote 16 chidren hashes. Each `#`
//       means the hash of its two direct children, which will be used to generate the hash of its
//       parent with the hash of its sibling. Finally, we can get the hash of this internal node.
//
//       However, if an internal node doesn't have all 16 chidren exist at height 0 but just a few of
//       them, we have a modified hashing rule on top of what is stated above:
//       1. From top to bottom, a node will be replaced by a leaf child if the subtree rooted at this
//       node has only one child at height 0 and it is a leaf child.
//       2. From top to bottom, a node will be replaced by the placeholder node if the subtree rooted at
//       this node doesn't have any child at height 0. For example, if an internal node has 3 leaf
//       children at index 0, 3, 8, respectively, and 1 internal node at index C, then the computation
//       graph will be like:"
//
//   4 ->              +------ root hash ------+
//                     |                       |
//   3 ->        +---- # ----+           +---- # ----+
//               |           |           |           |
//   2 ->        #           @           8           #
//             /   \                               /   \
//   1 ->     0     3                             #     @
//                                               / \
//   0 ->                                       C   @
//   ^
// height
// Note: @ denotes placeholder hash.
//
// To further elaborate: `C`, a BatchedInternalNode in our tree, is only present
// at height 0 if there are multiple keys with matching prefixes that have more than the
// number of bits from the root of the sparse merkle to height 0 of this tree.
// Concretely, if the displayed BatchedInternalNode is at depth 0 (height 256)
// of the entire sparse merkle tree, then 2 keys with 5 leading bits in common
// would cause `C` to be created and put at height 0 of this
// BatchedInternalNode. This scenario is demonstrated in the test
// `split_until_new_batch_node_needed` in `internal_node_test.cpp`.
