class SkvbcTracker:
    """
    Track requests, expected and actual responses from SimpleKVBC test
    clusters, and then allow verification of the linearizability of responses.

    The SkvbcTracker is used by a test to record messages sent and replies
    received to a cluster of SimpleKVBCTests TesterReplica nodes. Every request
    sent and reply received is recorded in `self.history`, and indexes into this
    history for requesets are frequently referred to by other parts of this
    code.

    By tracking outstanding requests in `self.outstanding` it is able to
    determine which requests are concurrent with which other requests, and track
    them in `self.concurrent`. The tracker also records a set of known blocks in
    `self.blocks` that it learns when ConditionalWrite replies are successful.

    Sometimes replies do not arrive for requests, and therefore the requests are never
    removed from self.outstanding. Such requests are considered concurrent with
    all future requests.

    Additionally, the tracker records all completed reads and failed writes so
    that they can be put into a total order with the blocks and checked for
    correctness (i.e. linearized).

    A test can send many requests to a cluster while it is also crashing nodes,
    creating partitions, instigating view changes, playing with clocks, and
    performing generally malicious actions. These failures can trigger missing
    replies as well as anomalies in the record of blocks themselves. The goal of
    the test is to try to trigger these anomalies via contentious writes and
    failures, such that any flaws in the implementation of concord-sbft can
    revealed when the tracker performs verification. When a failure is found the
    tracker state can be dumped along with the specific exception thrown to help
    developers reason about bugs in the code.

    Any complexity in this code stems primarily from the requirements and
    implementation of the verification procedure. Unlike general, dynamic
    model based linearizability checkers like
    [knossos](https://github.com/jepsen-io/knossos) or
    [porcupine](https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine), which attempt an
    NP-Hard search for correct linearizations soley from requests and responses,
    the SkvbcTracker relies on the total ordering of blocks provided by the
    TesterReplica implementation, and can perform correctness checks in linear
    time. However, the tester also records the complete history of requests and
    replies and can be used to generate a compatible output file that can then
    be verified using either knossos or porcupine.

    Every time a successful conditional write reply is received it includes the
    block number that it generated. This allows us to create a definitive total
    order for all blocks generated from requests that the tracker knows the
    replies of. However, we don't know the value of all blocks, because some
    replies may have been dropped. Before a test calls the `verify` method, it
    must retrieve and inform the tracker about any missing blocks. However, the
    test doesn't know which blocks are missing. The test will therfore call the
    `get_missing_blocks` method with the last_block_id of the cluster, that it
    retrieves after it is done sending read and write requests. The
    `get_missing_blocks` method will return a set of blocks which the test
    should retrieve from the replicas and then inform the tracker about with a
    call to `fill_missing_blocks`. After `fill_missing_blocks` is called the
    tracker will have a total order of all blocks in the system, thus obviating
    the need to perform an NP-hard search to find a write order that also
    satisfies concurrent reads and failed responses.

    An astute reader will note that we are trusting the TesterReplica cluster to
    tell us about the values of certain blocks, but that cluster is also the
    system under test that we are attempting to validate. At an absolute
    minimum, we want to make sure that any filled blocks could have been
    generated by outstanding requests. Therefore, the first step in verification
    is to call `_match_filled_blocks`. If any blocks could not have been
    generated by the outstanding requests, i.e. requests without replies, than a
    `PhantomBlockError` exception is raised. We could also try to order
    identical requests and blocks and determine if they could have successfully
    created those blocks based on their readsets not conflicting with writesets
    in the block history. However, this is an expensive search, that is probably
    similar to general linearizability testing in its complexity, and in long
    histories with many missing blocks may prolong all tests with little benefit. If we
    determine the need we can add this procedure later. The assumption here is that
    any incorrectness in the missing blocks will be detected via the inability
    of reads and failed requests to serialize, or be the result of unmatched
    requests. In other words, if the missing blocks are incorrect, other parts
    of the chain are likely incorrect and will be detected from the remaining
    parts of the verification procedure.

    The remaining parts of the verification procedure are documented in their
    respective methods, but will briefly be described here.

    `_verify_successful_writes` ensures that the readset in the write request
    does not intersect with the writesets in other requests that created blocks
    up until the creation of the block by this successful write. In essence, it
    is verifying compare and swap behavior, using the block id of the readset as
    a version.

    `_linearize_reads` ensures that the returned values of the read could have
    been returned from the *state* of the kvstore before or after any concurrent
    requests with the read.

    `_linearize_write_failures` works similarly to `_linearize_reads`, in that it
    looks at concurrent write requests to determine if there was an anomaly. The
    anomaly in this case would be if the failed request had a readset that
    didn't actually intersect with any writesets in concurrent requests. This
    would mean that there wasn't actually a conflict, and therefore the write
    should have succeeded. It's important to note here that we are only checking
    explicit failures returned from the cluster that are due to conflict errors
    in the replica's block state. We do not try to show that timeouts should not
    have failed. Any request that times out is not recorded as having a reply
    and remains in `self.outstanding`.

    It's important to note that the verification procedure returns the first
    error it finds in an exception. There may be other errors that were not
    reported but existed. In the future we may wish to change this code to track
    all (or most) errors and report a set of exceptions to the caller, to enable better
    debugging.

    One more check that may be useful is to take the complete chain in
    `self.blocks` and compare it to all blocks in the cluster at the end of the
    test run. The values should be identical. This can be an expensive check in
    clusters with lots of blocks, but we may want to add it as an optional check
    in the future.
