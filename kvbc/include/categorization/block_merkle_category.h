  //       Reversing step 1 is impossible. Reversing step 2 can be very expensive (for active keys).

  //   isn't onerous for the caller, and actually it doesn't really make any sense to do so anyway. In
  //   short, even without explicit protection in the caller this should be next to impossible to
  //   happen for the following reasons:
  //     * Blocks are pruned after creation on the order of days, weeks, or months
  //     * DeleteLastReachable will only delete blocks that have not been synced in the concord-bft
  //       internal metadata and during which a restart happened. This happens on the order of
  //        microseconds to milliseconds.
  //   In any event, blocks that aren't synced shouldn't even be eligible for pruning at an even higher level.

  // When a block gets pruned, any keys that are still `active` (latest version of a key) are
  // tracked in a `PrunedBlock`. PrunedBlocks are kept in their own column family. Additionally, a
  // new root hash is calculated for all remaining active keys in the block, and a new version of
  // the `MerkleBlockValue` is written into the block merkle tree. Lastly, each active key hash is
  // written into a separate column family with the pruned block_id as the value. These latter
  // active keys are necessary for garbage collection, while the `PrunedBlock` and `MerkleBlockValue`
  // are used to provide (and verify) proofs for active keys in pruned blocks.
  //
  // Garbage collection occurs when the block that first updated or deleted an active key from a
  // prior prune block is itself pruned. All keys in the current block being pruned are checked
  // during pruning to see if there were prior active keys from pruned blocks. If so, those prior
  // versions of the keys are deleted along with their active references used for garbage
  // collection. If any active keys remain for a pruned block, a new root hash is calculated, a new
  // PrunedBlock written, and the merkle tree is updated yet again for that block. If no active keys
  // remain for that pruned block, then the pruned block is deleted and the block is finally removed
  // from the merkle tree, as there are no longer any keys from that block eligible for proofs. This
  // garbage collection and update process is what is performed by this function.
  //
  // To reiterate: pruning (calling `deleteGenesisBlock`) does not always fully delete all data in a
  // block. If a key is at the latest version when the block is deleted, it is still `active` and
  // users can retrieve its data and prove that it is part of the blockchain. Any active keys become
  // `deactivated` when a new version of the key is written in a later block, or the key is deleted
  // in a later block. However, even though the key is no longer the latest version, it is not
  // deleted in this step. Final deletion from the database only occurs when the overwriting block
  // is itself pruned. This tradeoff is made to defer work to the pruning process and not cause
  // block addition to slow down.
