namespace concord::kvbc::v2MerkleTree {

// The DBAdapter class provides facilities for managing a key/value blockchain on top of a key/value store in the form
// of a sparse merkle tree.
//
// DBAdapter supports the notion of a blockchain with blocks linked to each other by a parent hash. The blockchain spans
// from block ID = 1 to block ID = getLastReachableBlockId(). Block outside of this range are considered temporary state
// transfer (ST) blocks that are transferred until blocks in the range [getLastReachableBlockId() + 1,
// getLatestBlockId()] are available. At the end of state transfer, getLastReachableBlockId() becomes equal to
// getLatestBlockId(), meaning that the two chains are linked. Temporary blocks are deleted once added to the
// blockchain. It can be represented visually as:
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// | 1 ... getLastReachableBlockId(), ST temp blocks ..., getLatestBlockId() |
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOTE: ST blocks don't need to be added in reverse order - they can be added in any order. When the
// getLastReachableBlockId() + 1 block is added, DBAdapter will link the chain in the range
// [getLastReachableBlockId() + 1, ReachableSTBlock], where ReachableSTBlock is a block that is reachable from block
// getLastReachableBlockId() + 1. Additionally, ReachableSTBlock <= getLatestBlockId().
class DBAdapter : public IDbAdapter {
 public:
  // The constructor will try to link the blockchain with any blocks in the temporary state transfer chain. This is done
  // so that the DBAdapter will operate correctly in case a crash or an abnormal shutdown has occurred prior to startup
  // (construction). Only a single DBAdapter instance should operate on a database and access to all methods
  // should be either done from a single thread or serialized via a mutex or another mechanism. The constructor throws
  // if an error occurs.
