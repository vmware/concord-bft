// Primary Thin Replica Client Library header file; you should include this file
// to use the Thin Replica Client Library.
//
// Several components of the thin replica client library are declared in this
// file:
//  - class UpdateQueue - A synchronized queue type to be used in transferring
//    updates between the Thin Replica Client and an application.
//  - class BasicUpdateQueue - Basic implementation of UpdateQueue
//    provided by this library.
//  - class ThinReplicaClient - Primary interface and implementation of the thin
//    replica client.
//
// Some general notes about the Thin Replica Client Library:
//  - std::string is used for passing byte strings to and from the library; this
//    is considered a cleaner solution than passing pointer/length pairs.
//    Note std::string is appropriate for byte strings because it is defined to
//    be std::basic_string<char> and chars are guaranteed to be one byte.
//  - The thin replica client mechanism associates each update with a specific
//    Block ID. Block IDs are 64-bit unsigned integer quantities. Updates a Thin
//    Replica Client receives from the Thin Replica Servers will have
//    monotonically increasing block numbers. An application using the
//    ThinReplicaClient Library should persist at least the block number for the
//    most recent update it received, as that block number can be used to resume
//    a subscription without having to first stream all the non-pruned updates
//    preceding that block number. An application using the ThinReplicaClient
//    library should use the ThinReplicaClient::AcknowledgeBlock to acknowledge
//    the block ID for each update it receives, as this is useful to the thin
//    replica servers for pruning decisions.
//  - It should be noted that the ThinReplicaClient itself logs via log4cplus;
//    specifically, it will log any noteworthy abnormalities it observes but
//    which it is its job to abstract out for the application using the library
//    rather than programatically expose to the application (ex: disagreement
//    among Thin Replica Servers).
