// Service error handling
// Each service method will return a gRPC status object.
// All errors are mapped to the common gRPC error codes defined here: https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html
// See each method for concrete explanations below.

// The RequestService allows the caller to submit requests to the blockchain
// network, and receive the result of the request in a synchronous response.
//
// You can use the EventService below for asynchronously consuming the
// events of submitted requests.
service RequestService {
  // Send a single request via the Concord Client to the blockchain network.
  // Errors:
  // DEADLINE_EXCEEDED: if the request couldn't be processed before the given timeout expired.
  // INVALID_ARGUMENT: if a required field is not set.
  // RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: if Concord Client is overloaded. The caller should retry with a backoff.
  // UNAVAILABLE: if Concord Client is currently unable to process any requests. The caller should retry with a backoff.
  // INTERNAL: if Concord Client cannot progress independent of the request.
  // ABORTED: this error is returned if the PreExecution read/time conditions are not met. TODO: which preexecution condition was violated?
