/******************************************************************************
 * Implementation class. Is reponsible for creating listener on given port,
 * outgoing connections to the lower Id peers and accepting connections from
 *  higher ID peers.
 *
 *  This is default behavior given the clients will always have higher IDs
 *  from the replicas. In this way we assure that clients will not connect to
 *  each other.
 *
 *  We will have to revisit this connection strategy once we have dynamic reconfiguration.
 *
 * ***************************
 * Threading Model
 * ***************************
 *
 * This implementation is based around [boost::asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/), which uses
 * non-blocking sockets and an event driven callback model. It uses an older version of boost
 * (1.65) which when upgraded will require some small changes to the code base, such as
 * `io_service` becoming `io_context`.
 *
 * To simplify the implementation, we only run a single io service thread. This thread handles all
 * connecting, accepting, sending, receiving, and timers for sockets.
 *
 * The current implementation maps a single `principle` (concord-bft replica or bft-client) to a
 * single ICommunication interface, backed by a single ASIO thread. All connections to and from
 * this principle are managed by this ASIO thread. ASIO is able to support much higher levels of
 * concurrency, and this behavior is currently an artificial limit, although it also simplifies the
 * implementation.
 *
 * Since all callbacks for asynchronous behavior occur on a single ASIO service thread, no mutexes
 * are required to protect data only touched by that thread. Most of the data managed by the
 * TlsTcpImpl and AsyncTlsConnection classes falls into this category. There are, however, two
 * scenarios (outside of diagnostics), where data must be made thread-safe, since the operations
 * come from other threads:
 *     1. Putting messages on a queue to be sent by the ASIO thread
 *     2. Queries for the current connection status
 *
 *  (1) occurs when the `ICommunication::SendAsyncMsg` method is called.
 *  (2) occurs when the `ICommunication::getCurrentConnectionStatus` method is called.
 *
 * **************************
 * Notes on Performance
 * **************************
 *
 * Copying
 * ----------------
 * The ICommunication and IReceiver interfaces' use of raw pointers in `sendAsyncMessage` and
 * `onNewMessage`,respeectively, force the callee to copy the data. This copying occurs once for
 * every message sent or received over a single socket. Compounding matters, the SBFT protocol
 * itself often sends identical messages to all replicas, thus forcing an additional copy before
 * the `sendAsyncMessage` method is called.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended that the ICommunication interface be changed to prevent this
 * unnecessary copying. Additionally, value types should be used to not only reduce copying, but
 * simplify the memory management/ownership model. One implementation choice would be to take
 * `std::vector<uint8_t>` rather than raw pointer/length pairs taken currently for both
 * `sendAsyncMessage` and `onNewMessage`. Additionally, a new `broadcast` call can be created that
 * passes a shared message buffer, such as a `Sliver` and a list of destinations, such that zero
 * copying is required to get N replicated messages into the IO thread.
 *
 * Thread Safety
 * ----------------
 * Currently all sockets are protected by a single mutex, `connections_guard_`. Since only a single
 * replica or client thread interacts with the IO thread, this probably works fine, as contention
 * is naturally limited. It's worth noting, however, that if more than one thread can send to
 * different endpoints, we may hit more contention, where more fine grained locks, or lockfree
 * strategies may make sense. This codebase is instrumted with histograms to enable discovery of
 * issues during both testing and production.
