/**
 * Output the required generated keys for a given replica to a file. The replica
 * can then read the keys back to fill out its bftEngine::ReplicaConfig& using
 * inputReplicaKeyFile below.
 *
 * @param replicaID      The replica ID for the replica to which this keyfile
 *                       will correspond. Note replica IDs should be in the
 *                       range [0, numReplicas - 1].
 * @param numReplicas    The total number of replicas in the deployment this
 *                       replica will be in. Note numReplicas must be equal to
 *                       (3 * f + 2 * c + 1).
 * @param f              The F parameter to SBFT for this deployment (the number
 *                       of byzantine faulty replicas to tolerate before safety
 *                       and/or correctness may be lost).
 * @param c              C parameter to the SBFT algorithm for this deployment
 *                       (the number of slow, crashed, or unresponsive replicas
 *                       that can be tolerated before falling back on the slow
 *                       path for commit consensus).
 * @param output         Output stream to which to write this keyfile.
 * @param outputFilename Filename to which output corresponds; this may be used
 *                       in giving more descriptive error messages.
 * @param rsaKeys        RSA keys generated for this deployment. It is expected
 *                       that there is one pair of keys per replica, each
 *                       represented as a pair of strings in rsaKeys, ordered by
 *                       replicaID. The private key should be the first string
 *                       in each pair and the public key the second.
 * @param execSys        Cryptosystem for consensus on execution results in this
 *                       deployment, with all keys already generated.
 * @param slowSys        Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the slow path for this deployment, with all keys
 *                       already generated.
 * @param commitSys      Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the general path for this deployment, with all keys
 *                       already generated.
 * @param optSys         Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the optimistic fast path for this deployment, with
 *                       all keys already generated.
 *
 * @return True if the keyfile was successfully output, false otherwise. Reasons *         this function could fail to
 * successfully output the keyfile may include I/O issues or disagreement of numReplicas with f and c.
