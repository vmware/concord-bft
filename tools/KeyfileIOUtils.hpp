/**
 * Output the required generated keys for a given replica to a file. The replica
 * can then read the keys back to fill out its bftEngine::ReplicaConfig& using
 * inputReplicaKeyFile below.
 *
 * @param numReplicas    The total number of replicas in the deployment this
 *                       replica will be in. Note numReplicas must be equal to
 *                       (3 * f + 2 * c + 1).
 *
 * @param numRoReplicas  The total number of read-only replicas in the deployment this
 *                       replica will be in.
 *
 * @param config         Replica configuration
 * @param outputFilename Filename to which output corresponds; this may be used
 *                       in giving more descriptive error messages.
 * @param execSys        Cryptosystem for consensus on execution results in this
 *                       deployment, with all keys already generated (regular replica).
 * @param slowSys        Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the slow path for this deployment, with all keys
 *                       already generated (regular replica).
 * @param commitSys      Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the general path for this deployment, with all keys
 *                       already generated (regular replica).
 * @param optSys         Cryptosystem for consensus on transaction commit order
 *                       in the optimistic fast path for this deployment, with
 *                       all keys already generated (regular replica).
