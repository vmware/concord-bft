Overview
----
Project Concord is a highly scalable and energy-efficient distributed trust infrastructure for consensus and smart contract execution.

concord-bft
----


The core engine of project Concord is concord-bft, a generic state machine replication library that can handle malicious (byzantine) replicas.
This library is designed to be used as a core building block for replicated distributed data stores, and is especially suited to serve as the basis of permissioned Blockchain systems.
Its implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paper [SBFT: a Scalable Decentralized Trust Infrastructure for
Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01626.pdf).

Releases
----

 [v0.5](https://github.com/vmware/concord-bft/releases/tag/v0.5)


Roadmap
----
We plan to release updates in a quarterly schedule. The next releases will include: optimized State transfer modules with rocksdb integration, configuration and key generation tools, generic key-value interface, and execution engine for EVM smart contracts. We also plan to support Windows, OS X, and additional Linux distributions.

Build (Ubuntu Linux)
----
### Dependencies

CMake and clang:

    sudo apt-get install cmake clang

Get GMP (dependency for [RELIC](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic)):

    sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev

Build and install [RELIC](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic)

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic
    cd relic/
    mkdir -p build/
    cd build/
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DALLOC=AUTO -DWSIZE=64 -DRAND=UDEV -DSHLIB=ON -DSTLIB=ON -DSTBIN=OFF -DTIMER=HREAL -DCHECK=on -DVERBS=on -DARITH=x64-asm-254 -DFP_PRIME=254 -DFP_METHD="INTEG;INTEG;INTEG;MONTY;LOWER;SLIDE" -DCOMP="-O3 -funroll-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -finline-small-functions -march=native -mtune=native" -DFP_PMERS=off -DFP_QNRES=on -DFPX_METHD="INTEG;INTEG;LAZYR" -DPP_METHD="LAZYR;OATEP" ..
    make
    sudo make install

Build and install [cryptopp](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp)

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp.git
    cd cryptopp/
    git checkout CRYPTOPP_5_6_5;
    mkdir build/
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

Get GNU Parallel

    sudo apt-get install parallel

Get g++:

    sudo apt-get install g++

#### (Optional) Use log4cplus

We have simple console logger but if you wish to use log4cplus - we have an
infra that supports it.

Follow below steps for installing this library:
1. Install prerequisites:

```
    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake
```

2. Clone the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/log4cplus/log4cplus.git
```

3. Move to the extracted directory and checkout the appropriate branch:

```
    cd log4cplus
    git checkout REL_1_2_1
```

4. Edit `configure` to change "am__api_version" from 1.14 to 1.15, the
version that ubuntu 16.04 supports.

5. Configure/make/install

```
    ./configure CXXFLAGS="--std=c++11"
    make
    sudo make install
```

Configuring with these flags is important. If log4cplus is build without `c++11` then athena will give linker errors while building.

At this point all library files and header files should be installed into `/usr/local`. (You may need to add `/usr/local/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).
You may also need to export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH variable set to /usr/local/include for the header files.

After installation, set USE_LOG4CPP flag to TRUE in the main CmakeLists.txt . The library doesn't initialize the log4cpp subsystem, including formats and appenders, it expects that the upper level application will do it and the log4cpp subsystem is already initialized.

#### (Optional) If you want to use Python test script
Install Python 3

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3

After the installation, please verify the version by running:

    python3 --version

It should be

    Python 3.x.x


### Select comm module
We support both UDP and TCP communication. UDP is the default. In order to
enable TCP communication, build with `-DBUILD_COMM_TCP_PLAIN=TRUE` in the cmake
instructions shown below.  If set, the test client will run using TCP. If you
wish to use TCP in your application, you need to build the TCP module as
mentioned above and then create the communication object using CommFactory and
passing PlainTcpConfig object to it.

### Build concord-bft

Create a build directory and enter it:

    cd
    mkdir -p concord-bft/build
    cd concord-bft/build

To perform a default build execute the following:

    cmake ..
    make

In order to turn on our off various options, you need to change your cmake configuration. This is
done by passing arguments to cmake with a `-D` prefix: e.g. `cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`. Note that
make must be run afterwards to build according to the configuration. The following options are
useful for building concord-bft:

 * `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`     - Debug | Release | RelWithDebInfo | MinSizeRel (DEFAULT Debug)
 * `BUILD_TESTING`        - OFF | ON  (DEFAULT ON)
 * `BUILD_COMM_TCP_PLAIN` - TRUE | FALSE (DEFAULT FALSE - UDP is used)
 * `USE_LOG4CPP`          - TRUE | FALSE (DEFAULT FALSE)
 * `CONCORD_LOGGER_NAME`  - STRING (DEFAULT "concord")

Run examples
----

### Simple test application (4 replicas and 1 client on a single machine)

Tests are compiled into in the build directory and can be run from anywhere as
long as they aren't moved.

Run the following from the top level concord-bft directory:

   ./build/bftengine/tests/simpleTest/scripts/testReplicasAndClient.sh

Alternatively you can run `runReplicas.sh` and `runClient.sh` from the same
directory as `testReplicasAndClient.sh`.

### Using simple test application via Python script

You can use the simpleTest.py script to run various configurations via a simple
command line interface.
Please find more information [here](bftengine/tests/simpleTest/README.md)
